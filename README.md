# Face Detection and Recognition System 🧑🔍

## Introduction 🌟

This repository houses an advanced face recognition system that leverages a database of facial images to identify individuals within a given photograph. Crafted with the power of Python and its robust libraries like `face_recognition` and `opencv`, this system is not only accurate but also user-friendly.

## Features 🚀

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces within images. 🔎
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces against a pre-established database to identify individuals. 👤
- **Annotation**: Labels recognized faces with rectangles and their corresponding names. 🏷️
- **Scalability**: Designed with future enhancements in mind, including video file processing. 📈

## Installation 💻

Ensure you have Python installed, and then set up the required libraries with the following commands:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python
